# TicTacToe game
TicTacToe is a feature of covey.town in which users in the same town can compete against each other in a game of tic-tac-toe. 

## Playing the game

### How to play
1. Navigate to the 'TicTacToe Board' section of the map
2. Press the `space bar` to open the game board
3. Click 'Start game' 
4. Wait for a second player to join the game (see note in **Notes** about playing as a single user) 
5. Click on a square to make a move. You will not be able to make a move (it will not register) if you go out of turn or choose an already-selected square
6. Play TicTacToe against your opponent
7. If you want to leave the game at any point, click the 'Quit' button
8. If you play until the end of the game and there is a winner, the winner will be awarded points and the loser will get 0 points. If it is a draw, neither player gets any points. These points will be reflected in the leaderboard (see next section). 

### Notes
- This is a two player game. This means:
  - A single user in the room cannot play the game (note: if you join as two different users from two separate browser windows, you can simulate two players and play the game)
  - Any users that try to join the game after two players are already in the game will not be able to join the game until after the current game finishes
